                    <h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
                    
                    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                    <p>At ClipFy Media Toolkit, we prioritize protecting your privacy while you use our app, which provides comprehensive media processing tools such as video, audio, and image editing. This policy explains how we handle user data, required permissions, and the measures taken to safeguard your information.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Permissions:</h2>
                    <p>The ClipFy Media Toolkit app requests certain permissions to function properly and provide the best user experience, including:</p>
                    
                    <h4>Storage Access</h4>
                    <p>This permission allows the app to access media files (videos, audios, images) on your device so you can select and process them within the app, such as compressing, converting, or trimming.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Notification & Foreground Service</h4>
                    <p>This permission enables the app to process files in the background and show notifications displaying the progress of operations like compression or conversion, allowing you to monitor status without keeping the app open.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Third Party Services:</h2>
