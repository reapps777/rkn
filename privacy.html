                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>At <strong>DevTech</strong>, we take your privacy seriously. We understand that the information related to your device and usage is sensitive, and we're committed to protecting it.

                <h2>App Permissions Explained</h2>

                    <li><strong>Why we need it:</strong> This is the core of what our video player does. Without this permission, you couldn't browse or play your own videos.</li>
                    <li><strong>How we use it:</strong> We only access the video files you specifically select for playback. We never scan your entire device or access other types of files.</li>
